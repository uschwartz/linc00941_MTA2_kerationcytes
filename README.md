# The long non-coding RNA LINC00941 regulates human epidermal homeostasis through interaction with the MTA2/NuRD complex

### ABSTRACT
Numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were shown to have functional impact on cellular processes, such as human epidermal homeostasis, but for only a few the mode of action has been elucidated. Here, we report that lncRNA LINC00941 controls keratinocyte differentiation on a global level through association with the MTA2/NuRD complex, one of the major chromatin remodelers in cells. LINC00941 was found to interact with NuRD-associated MTA2, suppressing the expression of the transcription factor EGR3, a regulator of epidermal differentiation. Both, LINC00941 and the MTA2/NuRD complex are enriched in non-differentiated keratinocytes and repress the expression of differentiation genes through epigenetic silencing of EGR3, consequentially repressing premature differentiation of human progenitor cells.


CODE used to analyse ChIPseq and RNAseq data:
+ 01_ChIPseq: scripts for QC, mapping and peak calling of MTA2
+ 02_RNAseq: scripts for QC, mapping, expression quantification and differential gene expression analysis of siLINC00941
+ 03_Downstream: Code used to generate main figures and differential MTA2 peak calling
